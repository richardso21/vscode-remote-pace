# vscode-remote-pace

A one-click script to setup and connect vscode to a Slurm-based HPC compute node (e.g. Georgia Tech PACE ICE/Phoenix/Firebird/etc. login node) directly from the remote explorer.

## Features
- Automatically starts a batch job, or reuses an existing one, for vscode to connect to.
- No need to manually execute the script on the HPC, just connect from the remote explorer and the script handles everything automagically through `ProxyCommand`.

## Requirements
> __*PACE should meet all of these requirements, leaving here for reference.*__
- `sshd` must be available on the compute node, installed in `/usr/sbin` or available in the PATH
- A typical `sshd` installation is required, it must read login keys from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- You must be allowed to run `sshd` in a batch job on an arbitrary port above 10000, and connect to it from the login node
- The `nc` command (netcat) must be available on the HPC login node
- Names of Slurm nodes must resolve to their internal IP addresses
- You must have SSH access to the HPC login node

These requirements are usually met, except if explicitly changed or forbidden by your system admin.

## Setup
> __*Instructions below are specific to PACE ICE, but should be similar for Phonenix and others.*__

Git clone the repo on the PACE login node (replace `<username>` with your own) and run the installer.

```shell
ssh <username>@login-ice.pace.gatech.edu
git clone git@github.com:richardso21/vscode-remote-pace.git
cd vscode-remote-pace
bash install.sh
```

The script will be installed in `~/bin` and added to your PATH.

Open the installed script `~/bin/vscode-remote` with your favourite editor and edit the `SBATCH_PARAM_CPU` and `SBATCH_PARAM_GPU` parameters at the top according to your Slurm system. It is recommended to keep the job time (`-t`) as default or less, to not waste resources.

On your local machine, generate a new ssh key for vscode-remote:

```shell
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/vscode-remote -t ed25519 -N ""
```

Copy the public key to PACE login node's `authorized_hosts`, or you can use `ssh-copy-id`:

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/vscode-remote HPC-LOGIN
```

In VS Code, change the `remote.SSH.connectTimeout` setting. Set this to the maximum time in seconds you expect a new job to start on your HPC. The script default is `300`.

```yaml
"remote.SSH.connectTimeout": 300
```

Add the following entry to your local machine's `~/.ssh/config`. Change `USERNAME` and `HPC-LOGIN` accordingly:

```bash
Host vscode-remote-cpu
    User <username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vscode-remote
    ProxyCommand ssh <username>@login-ice.pace.gatech.edu "bash --login -c 'vscode-remote cpu'"
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

You can add a new entry and change `vscode-remote cpu` to `vscode-remote gpu` to start a GPU job.

## Usage
The `vscode-remote-cpu` host is now available in the VS Code remote explorer. Connecting to this host will automatically launch a batch job on a CPU node and connect to the node.

If a running job is already found, it will simply connect to it. You can also open as many remote windows as you like and they will all share the same running job.

The `vscode-remote` command installed on your HPC offers some commands to list or cancel running jobs. Type `vscode-remote help` for help on its usage.
